# VVL-VAPF
An Efficient Occlusion-Aware Visibility Assurance Method.
These folders contain the code for algorithms and experimental processes.
## Experiments 1
This folder contains two files.
- RobotData_Exp1_Virtual.m : Configuration information of elements such as robots and cameras in a virtual environment.
- TestCameraModellnRobotEnvVAPF.m : Test the VVL to determine the occlusion relationship between the robot and the camera.
