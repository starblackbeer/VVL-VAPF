# VVL-VAPF
An Efficient Occlusion-Aware Visibility Assurance Method.
These folders contain the code for algorithms and experimental processes.
## Experiments 1
This folder contains two files.
- RobotData_Exp1_Virtual.m : Configuration information of elements such as robots and cameras in a virtual environment.
- TestDetectOcclusionBetweenTwoRobotsBasedVVL.m : Test the VVL to determine the occlusion relationship between the robot and the camera.
## Experiments 2
This folder contains three files.
- AngleArray.m : Configuration information of 75 groups of robot joints.
- RobotData_Exp2_Virtual.m : Configuration information of elements such as robots and cameras in a virtual environment.
- TestRemoveOcclusionWithTwoRobotsBasedVAPF.m : Test VAPF to remove the occlusion of the camera by the robot.
## GJK DISTANCE
This folder contains three files.
- GJK_dist.m : Calculate the distance and the nearest point between two convex bodies based on the Minkowski difference.
- GJK_dist.m : Calculate the collision state between two convex bodies based on the Minkowski difference.
- pointTriangleDistance.m : Subfunctions of GJK_dist.
- support_2.m : Subfunctions of GJK_dist.
- distLinSeg : Subfunctions of GJK_dist.
